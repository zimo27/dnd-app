**Objective:**
Building on your Next.js AI D&D app, your task is to integrate **at least one interactive mini-game mechanic** within a **50-minute** session. This tests your ability to quickly implement relevant features and integrate them into an existing application.

**Core Tasks (50 Minutes):**

1. **Select Mechanic:** Choose 1+ suitable mini-game(s) from the provided list (e.g., Timing Bar, Sequence Match, Quick Math) that could logically resolve actions or challenges within the D&D scenarios (like using a `baseSkill`).
2. **Implement:** Build the core functionality of the chosen mini-game(s) as interactive Next.js components. Focus on making it work; polish is secondary.
3. **Trigger:** Modify the app flow so the mini-game launches when a relevant player action occurs (e.g., attempting a specific `baseSkill`).
4. **Handle Outcome:** Ensure the mini-game clearly displays a success or failure result to the player.
5. **(Stretch Goal) Difficulty Scaling:** Discuss or implement basic difficulty adjustment based on character `attributes` from the scenario template.
6. **(Stretch Goal) AI Feedback:** Pass the mini-game's success/failure outcome back to the main game loop (e.g., add it to the next AI prompt).

**Resources:**

- Your existing AI D&D application codebase (Next.js/Supabase).
- The list of 18 mini-game mechanic examples.

**Evaluation Focus:**

- Appropriate selection and rapid implementation of the mini-game mechanic.
- Logical triggering within the existing gameplay flow.
- Functional interactive component development in Next.js.
- Clear code and effective problem-solving within the time limit.
- (Bonus) Approach to difficulty scaling and AI feedback.

**Deliverable:**
A working demonstration of the integrated mini-game(s) and a brief verbal explanation of your choices and implementation approach at the end of the 50 minutes.

1. **Timing Bar (Slider):**
    - **Mechanic:** An indicator moves (slides left/right, fills up, rotates) across a bar or shape. Press a button when it's in the designated "success" zone(s).

    - **Variations:** Multiple zones, shrinking zones, zones that move, multiple indicators, required hits in sequence.
    - **Common Uses:** Lockpicking, fishing (casting/reeling), critical hits, crafting quality, dialogue persuasion, hacking.
