I want a similar mini-game like the previous one. This game involves the following

**Rhythm Matching:**
    - **Mechanic:** Press specific buttons in time with visual cues (approaching icons, flashing lights) or audio beats.

    - **Variations:** Simple single-button presses, directional inputs, hold-and-release notes.
    - **Common Uses:** Spellcasting, musical performances, complex crafting steps, certain machine interactions.

the mini-game triggering scenario would be when the user executes a unsuccessful skill, the system prompts that the president is mad, now it trigger the second mini-game, at which the 
player needs to play a Rhythm Matching game by pressing 4 keyboard buttons. button a, w, s, d. to match the Rhythm. If the user matches all rythms
, lets say matched 10 Rhythm/keys, the user is successful, president no longer mad.
